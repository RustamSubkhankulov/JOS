/* User-level fork with copy-on-write.
 * Create a child.
 * Lazily copy our address space and page fault handler setup to the child.
 * Then mark the child as runnable and return.
 *
 * Returns: child's envid to the parent, 0 to the child, < 0 on error.
 * It is also OK to panic on error.
 *
 * Hint:
 *   Use sys_map_region, it can perform address space copying in one call
 *   Remember to fix "thisenv" in the child process.
